# Google Play Compliance Notes (MVP planning)

This repository milestone does not yet include full Android billing + VpnService implementation. Planned compliance requirements:

- Use Google Play Billing for subscription + free trial.
- Backend entitlement checks gate VPN config issuance.
- Provide clear VpnService disclosure in app onboarding and store listing.
- Data Safety should disclose minimal identity and subscription metadata only.
- Avoid collecting traffic content or browsing logs.
